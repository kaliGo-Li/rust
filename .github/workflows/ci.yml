# This file defines our primary CI workflow that runs on pull requests
# and also on pushes to special branches (auto, try).
#
# The actual definition of the executed jobs is calculated by the
# `src/ci/citool` crate, which
# uses job definition data from src/ci/github-actions/jobs.yml.
# You should primarily modify the `jobs.yml` file if you want to modify
# what jobs are executed in CI.
